Topic：Six Thinking Hats: Starting a Team's Journey to Innovation
A detailed discussion of an innovation method
1.History and background：
Edward de Bono, a Maltese psychologist and educator, is famous for promoting creative thinking methods. He believed that creative thinking was needed to solve problems because people tended to think in a single mode, limiting perspectives. For this reason, he invented the Six Thinking Hats method in 1985 to promote diverse thinking.
The Six Thinking Hats method was created by Dr Edward de Bono in the mid-1980s.
2.Introduction of White hat：
This hat represents objective facts and information. 
A person using the white hat would ask, "What information do we have? What information do we need?"
3.Introduction of Red hat：
Red hats represent emotion and intuition without explanation or reason. 
The question under this hat is, "What is our gut reaction? How do we feel about this issue?“
4.Introduction of Black hat：
This hat represents caution and critical thinking. 
The black hat thinks about asking questions like, "What could go wrong here? What are the weaknesses in this plan?"
5.Introduction of Yellow hat：
The yellow hat represents optimism and hope and is used to explore the value and possible benefits of an idea. 
A person using a yellow hat would explore, "What are the benefits of this idea? How is it feasible?"
6.Introduction of Green hat：
Green hats represent creativity and new ideas. 
The Green Hat question might be, "What creative solutions can we have? How can we move beyond the status quo?"
7.Introduction of Blue hat：
Blue Hat focuses on the thinking process itself.
The Blue Hat questions are, "What should we do next? What are the conclusions of our discussion? Have we considered all perspectives?"
8.Application Example:
The Six Thinking Hats are used as a brainstorming and decision-making tool in team meetings and decision-making processes. For example, in a team developing a new product, team members may take turns trying out different thinking hats.
In applying the Six Thinking Hats methodology, the team collects factual data through the White Hat, shares gut feelings through the Red Hat, assesses risks through the Black Hat, searches for opportunities through the Yellow Hat, stimulates creativity through the Green Hat, and finally integrates the discussion and formulates conclusions through the Blue Hat.
9.A strategy for promoting and implementing the Six Thinking Hats within an organisation should include the following steps:
Introduction of seminars, Practice Exercises, Coaching and Feedback, Integration into processes, Ongoing support
